fluenium

No it's not a matter that I'm sick. OK, I'm sick about testing software I ever done.

Because I love the e2e testing, and I'd like to utilize it in the UI project, I started to develop test using Selenium.
But to be honest the selenium API... is not what I like, and more over is not what I'd like to learn developers who doesn’t know too much about the Java programming.
I also given a try with Protractor e2e testing, but because I'm not a JS developer I'm not feeling comfortable with languages without type checking. Maybe soon I will enjoy tools like Typescript, but since this time I'd like to use my favorite Java languages and define automatic tests for the web UI.

So here's comes the idea, why I can not write my tests that way, so even my non-very technical friend will be able to read it. And then I realized, that I'm creating a new wrapper for the Selenium tests framework, which simply makes the syntax so nice that even Edgar Alan Poe can write tests using it! So here you go, the Fluent Selenium, so called fluenium.

Hope you will enjoy it, and join the project so together we will implement a new brilliant language for test development.

Hence this project is extremely new, and needs in my opinion a lot of attention, please do not hesitate to fork it, and extend it in any way you wish.
